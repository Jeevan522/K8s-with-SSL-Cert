A new name space 'spike' is create and all the pods and services will be available in this NS.

We cannot have the CERTIFICATE RESOURCE in the newly created NS, this will not allows to get the SSL. 
This resource should be in DEFAULT NS only.

In the ingress file we have the path based routing and for this an ingress annotation is required to get the path based routing results.

Annotation: nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /

We have 3 different services and added the path accordingly to the Ingress.
